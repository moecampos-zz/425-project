# Conclusion

It has become that much easier to pillage the seven seas now that we have investigated the pricing of Airbnb listings in Venice. In particular, we have found that pricing is similar for most neighborhoods, except that San Marco and Dorsoduro tend to have higher prices than the rest. We built a pricing model to help pirates determine their costs while staying in the area, which considered availability, neighborhood choice, room type, number of reviews, and number of reviews per month. We also discovered which attractions were primary features of each neighborhood via text analysis. We hope that our analysis has provided insights to friendly pirates everywhere!
